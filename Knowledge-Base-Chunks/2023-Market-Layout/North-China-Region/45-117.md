## 3. Retail Network Analysis: 250 Stores

The network of two hundred and fifty retail stores is the primary interface with our customers and the backbone of the region's sales operations. This network is not monolithic; it is a carefully segmented ecosystem of different store formats, each designed to serve a specific purpose and target a particular customer demographic. The management of this network involves strategic site selection, standardized operational procedures, and continuous performance evaluation.

## 4. Financial Performance: $1.05 Billion Annual Revenue

The North China Region's annual revenue of one billion and fifty million dollars is a result of the effective execution of its market and retail strategies. This revenue is not evenly distributed but reflects the diverse economic strengths and market maturity of the constituent provinces and the strategic roles of different store formats.

### 4.1. Revenue Contribution by Province

The revenue breakdown provides insights into the economic dynamics of the region:
*   **Northern Plains Province:** As the most developed market, it contributes the largest share, accounting for approximately 35-40% of the total regional revenue. This is driven by the high number of stores and strong consumer purchasing power.

*   **Boutique Stores & Reseller Kiosks:** The remaining revenue is generated by boutique stores, which have a high average transaction value, and the extensive network of reseller kiosks, which contribute through high volume of smaller transactions.

### 4.3. Key Revenue Drivers and Profitability
