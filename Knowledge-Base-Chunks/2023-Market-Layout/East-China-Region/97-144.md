## III. Regional Consolidated Analysis

**1. Retail Network Synthesis (320 Stores Total):**
The regional network of 320 stores is a balanced portfolio of different formats and locations. Approximately 15% are high-profile flagship and premium experience centers in Tier 1 cities, which drive both revenue and brand equity. The majority, around 65%, are standard mall stores that form the sales backbone across all major cities. The remaining 20% consist of community stores and authorized reseller points, which enhance market penetration and accessibility. This tiered approach allows for a flexible and efficient allocation of capital, maximizing both brand impact and sales coverage across the diverse economic landscape of East China.

**2. Regional Revenue Analysis ($1.28 Billion Total):**
The $1.28 billion in annual revenue is a testament to the region's strength. The revenue distribution reflects the economic hierarchy of the provinces, with Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang collectively accounting for over 60% of the total. However, the strong growth momentum in inland provinces like Anhui and the steady contribution from large markets like Shandong highlight the diversified and resilient nature of the regional revenue stream. The strategy of balancing high-value sales in mature markets with volume-driven growth in emerging ones has proven to be highly successful.

**3. Regional Operations and Logistics:**
The entire East China Region is supported by a sophisticated logistics and supply chain network. A primary regional distribution center, strategically located near Shanghai, serves as the main hub. From there, products are dispatched to smaller provincial warehouses in cities like Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Jinan. This hub-and-spoke model ensures efficient inventory management, reduces delivery lead times to stores, and allows for rapid reallocation of stock based on real-time sales data. This operational backbone is critical to supporting the high sales velocity and diverse product needs of the 320 retail stores.

**4. Conclusion:**
The East China Region is a model of operational excellence and commercial success. Its comprehensive retail network, diversified provincial strategies, and robust financial performance make it the most important region in our domestic market. The combination of established, high-value markets and high-growth, emerging territories provides a balanced portfolio for sustained success. The regional team's ability to execute tailored strategies while maintaining consistently high operational standards across all seven provinces is the key driver behind its outstanding contribution of 320 retail stores and $1.28 billion in annual revenue.
