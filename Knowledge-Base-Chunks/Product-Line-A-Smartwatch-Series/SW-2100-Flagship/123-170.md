## The Ultimate Fitness Companion

Whether you are a professional athlete or just starting your fitness journey, the SW-2100-Flagship is the ultimate tool to track your progress, motivate you, and help you achieve your goals.

### Precision in Motion: Multi-Band GNSS

For outdoor activities like running, cycling, and hiking, accurate location tracking is paramount. The SW-2100 features a cutting-edge multi-band Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. It can simultaneously access signals from multiple satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) across different frequency bands (L1 and L5). This dramatically improves accuracy in challenging environments like dense cities with tall buildings or deep canyons with limited sky view, providing you with precise data on your pace, distance, and route.

### A Universe of Workouts

The SW-2100 comes pre-loaded with a vast array of workout modes, covering everything from traditional activities like running and swimming to more niche pursuits like rock climbing, yoga, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Each workout mode is tailored to capture the most relevant metrics for that specific activity. For example, swimming tracks stroke type and SWOLF score, while weight training can automatically detect sets and reps.

### Advanced Dynamics and Performance Metrics

For serious athletes, the watch provides a wealth of advanced metrics. Runners can analyze their form with data on vertical oscillation, ground contact time, stride length, and even running power measured directly from the wrist. Cyclists can connect to external power meters and cadence sensors via Bluetooth for a comprehensive view of their performance. All this data is beautifully visualized in the companion app, allowing you to track your long-term progress and identify areas for improvement.
