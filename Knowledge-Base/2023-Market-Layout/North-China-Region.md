## 5. Regional Strategy and Outlook

The North China Region's strategy is centered on three pillars: consolidating its leadership in mature markets, accelerating growth in emerging areas, and continuously enhancing operational excellence. The outlook for the region remains positive, with several avenues for future growth. The focus will be on deepening the market penetration within the existing six provinces rather than expanding geographically. This involves strategically adding new stores in underserved urban areas and upgrading existing stores to enhance the customer experience. There is a significant opportunity to increase revenue by improving the performance of existing assets through enhanced staff training, localized marketing initiatives, and the introduction of new in-store services. By leveraging its established infrastructure, strong brand presence, and deep understanding of the local market, the North China Region is well-positioned to continue its trajectory as a leading contributor to the company's overall success.
