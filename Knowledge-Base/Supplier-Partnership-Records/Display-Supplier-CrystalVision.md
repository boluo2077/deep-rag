## Section 4: Detailed Breakdown of Supplied Components

CrystalVision Inc. supplies two main categories of display technology to our organization: AMOLED and OLED panels. Each category includes a range of custom-specified modules tailored to our specific product requirements.

### 4.1 AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode) Displays

The AMOLED panels from CrystalVision form the visual centerpiece of our premium product tiers. These displays are renowned for their exceptional image quality, design flexibility, and power efficiency.

*   **Core Characteristics:**
    *   **Contrast Ratio:** Due to their self-emissive nature, where each pixel generates its own light, CrystalVision's AMOLEDs achieve virtually infinite contrast ratios. Blacks are truly black because the pixels are completely turned off, creating a stunning depth and realism in the displayed image.
    *   **Color Gamut:** The panels are calibrated to cover wide color gamuts, typically exceeding 100% of the DCI-P3 color space. This results in vibrant, saturated, and lifelike colors.
    *   **Response Time:** Pixel response times are in the microsecond range, orders of magnitude faster than traditional LCDs. This eliminates motion blur and ghosting, providing exceptional clarity for fast-moving content.
    *   **Form Factor:** We procure both rigid AMOLED panels on glass substrates and flexible AMOLED panels on polyimide substrates. The flexible panels enable curved and edge-to-edge screen designs that are central to our industrial design language.

*   **Custom Specifications Provided:**
    *   **Resolution and Pixel Density:** We specify a range of resolutions, from Full HD+ to Quad HD+, with pixel densities often exceeding 500 pixels per inch (PPI) for razor-sharp text and images.
    *   **Variable Refresh Rate (VRR):** Many of the supplied modules incorporate LTPS backplane technology that supports dynamic refresh rates. This allows the screen to intelligently adjust its refresh rate, dropping to very low frequencies for static content to save power and ramping up for smooth scrolling and animation.
    *   **Peak Brightness and HDR:** The panels are engineered to achieve high peak brightness levels, essential for outdoor visibility and for rendering High Dynamic Range (HDR) content with spectacular highlights.
    *   **Integrated Touch Solutions:** CrystalVision provides "On-Cell Touch" solutions where the touch-sensing layer is integrated directly into the display's encapsulation layer. This reduces the overall thickness and weight of the display stack and improves optical clarity.

*   **Quality Assurance Protocols for AMOLEDs:**
    *   **Mura Correction:** Every panel undergoes a "de-mura" process, where sophisticated algorithms and optical measurements are used to compensate for minute variations in brightness uniformity across the display, ensuring a perfectly even image.
    *   **Burn-in Mitigation:** CrystalVision implements a combination of hardware and software techniques to mitigate image retention (burn-in). This includes pixel-shifting algorithms, dynamic voltage control, and the use of more robust blue emitter materials, which historically have had a shorter lifespan.

### 4.2 OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) Displays

While AMOLEDs are used for our main product displays, we also source various other types of OLED panels from CrystalVision, often referred to as Passive-Matrix OLEDs (PMOLED) or smaller, simpler AMOLEDs for secondary functions.

*   **Distinction and Use Cases:**
    *   Unlike AMOLEDs, which use a TFT backplane to control each pixel individually, PMOLEDs use a simpler grid matrix to address pixels. This makes them less complex and more cost-effective for smaller, lower-resolution applications.
    *   These displays are typically used for secondary information tickers, status indicators, or in devices where a full-fledged graphical user interface is not required.

*   **Specific OLED Variants Supplied:**
    *   **Monochrome PMOLEDs:** We procure small, single-color (e.g., white, amber, or blue) PMOLED displays. These are highly energy-efficient and offer excellent readability in a variety of lighting conditions, making them ideal for simple status displays.
    *   **Small-Format Color OLEDs:** For applications requiring more than just text, we source small, full-color OLED panels. While they may not have the high resolution or refresh rate of their larger AMOLED counterparts, they provide a significant upgrade in visual quality compared to traditional LCDs in the same form factor.

*   **Performance and Reliability:**
    *   **Longevity:** CrystalVision provides detailed lifetime specifications for these panels, typically rated in tens of thousands of hours of operation before reaching 50% of their initial brightness.
    *   **Power Efficiency:** The power consumption profile of these displays is a key consideration. CrystalVision provides detailed characterization data showing power draw under various usage scenarios, which is critical for our system-level power budget calculations.
    *   **Environmental Tolerance:** These smaller modules are also subjected to rigorous environmental testing to ensure they can operate reliably across a wide range of temperatures and humidity levels, consistent with the intended use cases of our products.
